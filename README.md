# Colorimetric-Sensing-Patches

Colorimetric sensing patches are designed to monitor biomarkers in sweat, primarily pH, and temperature. The devices are low cost colorimetric sensors, which are developed by both analog and digital printing. 

An object detection algorithm can be used to detect the patches on an embedded system using an integrated camera. A subsequent model can then map the sensing units to pH and temperature values.
